Automatic Machine Learning is a fairly hot topic at the moment. However, current approaches don't really address feature engineering (which is the "art" of data science and ML). A number of commercial offerings have automated ML, and there are open source options too â€“ including one in Weka, called Auto Weka.<BR>
